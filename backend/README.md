# OPlus Telemedicine Backend

This folder contains the backend code for the OPlus Telemedicine platform. Here's what should be included in this folder to complete the website:

1. `server.js`: The main entry point for the backend server.
2. `config/`: Configuration files for the database, environment variables, etc.
3. `models/`: Database models for User, Appointment, Message, Complaint, etc.
4. `routes/`: API route handlers for different endpoints.
5. `controllers/`: Business logic for handling requests.
6. `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions (e.g., authentication).
7. `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
8. `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the backend.

To set up the backend:

1. Initialize a new Node.js project in this folder.
2. Install necessary dependencies (Express.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, etc.).
3. Implement the server, routes, and controllers.
4. Set up the database connection and models.
5. Implement authentication and authorization.
6. Create API endpoints for user management, appointments, messaging, etc.
7. Write tests for your backend code.
8. Set up proper error handling and logging.

Remember to keep your backend code secure, scalable, and well-documented.
